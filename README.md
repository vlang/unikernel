## What is V-Unikernel all about?

- Keeping the code as simple and easy to understand as possible, while not sacrificing performance and prioritising code correctness.
- Making a *usable* unikernel which can *run on real hardware*, not just on emulators or virtual machines.
- Targeting modern 64-bit architectures, CPU features, and multi-core computing.
- Maintaining good source-level compatibility with Linux to allow to easily port programs over.
- Exploring V capabilities in unikernel development.
- Having fun.

**Note: V-Unikernel is still pre-alpha software not meant for daily or production usage!**

## What is a unikernel?

- A unikernel is a computer program statically linked with the operating system code on which it depends.
